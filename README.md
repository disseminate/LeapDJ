LeapDJ
===
This is a LeapMotion MIDI controller made by me at McHacks 2015. It uses a loopMIDI device and the LeapMotion SDK to reflect MIDI commands based on hand motion. It was mainly made to control Traktor 2 software.

This was made mostly as a proof of concept and exercise than an actual project, but was still a good learning experience.
